## Exploiting the MS08-067 vulnerability without Metasploit

I'm currently enrolled in Offensive Security's Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course.  My intention is to obtain the OSCP Certification.  
During the OSCP Certification Exam the use of Metasploit is limited, therefore I am not using Metasploit when exploiting the servers in the lab environment.  Here are the steps I took to perform my first exploit - MS08-067 - without the use of Metasploit.

I targeted the Netbios service by using Nmap's smb-check-vulns script

	nmap -v -p 139, 445 --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args=unsafe=1 192.168.31.205

Nmap returned the following
