I'm currently enrolled in Offensive Security's Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course.  My intention is to obtain the OSCP Certification.  
During the OSCP Certification Exam the use of Metasploit is limited, therefore I am not using Metasploit when exploiting the servers in the lab environment.  Here are the steps I took to perform my first exploit - MS08-067 - without the use of Metasploit.

I targeted the Netbios service by using Nmap's smb-check-vulns script on a Windows 2000 Server

	nmap -v -p 139, 445 --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args=unsafe=1 192.168.31.205

Nmap returned the following

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nmap-ms08067-vulnerable.png)

Search exploit-db for an exploit and found the following

-exploit db picture goes here

The exploit code states that impacket and pycrypto are required
	cd /opt/
    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/i/impacket/impacket-0.9.13.tar.gz
    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz
    tar -xzf impacket-0.9.13.tar.gz
    tar -xzf pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz
 
Did some research and understood that I also needed python dev tools installed in order to build pycrypto
	apt-get install python-dev
    
Changed the permissions on the impacket folder and ran 
	./setup.py

Changed the permissions on the pycrypto folder and run
	python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
